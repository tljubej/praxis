//! Runtime ABI versioning (§11.6).

//! cross-version compatibility promise, and no externally linkable surface for
//! user programs. Even so, the compiler and runtime are built from the same
//! workspace, and a single constant — checked at startup — catches accidental
//! internal drift between the code that *generates* calls and the code that
//! *implements* them.

/// The runtime ABI version for this build. Bump this whenever the layout of
/// [`RuntimeContext`](crate::RuntimeContext), the calling convention, or the
/// signature set of `praxis_*` runtime wrappers changes in an incompatible way.
pub const RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION: u32 = 1;

/// Assert that the compiler's expected ABI version matches this build's.
///
/// Called once at CLI / LSP startup. Today the compiler and runtime are the
/// same binary, so the assertion is trivially satisfied; the point is to have
/// the check in place before the runtime is split across build artifacts.
///
/// # Panics
/// Panics if the versions disagree. A disagreement is always a build bug, never
/// a user-facing condition.
